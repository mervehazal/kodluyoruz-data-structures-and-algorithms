## 1. [7,5,1,8,3,6,0,9,4,2]

##### First we choose the first element as root. We compare 7 and 5, since 5 is less than 7 we put 5 to left hand side. 
##### Next number is 1. Since 1 is less than 7 and 5 we put 1 as child of 5 to the left hand side.
##### Next number is 8. Since 8 is greater than 7 we put 8 to the right hand side as child of 7.
##### Next-number is 3. 3 is less than 5 but since there is no room on the left hand side we have to put 3 as child of 1 to the right hand size. 
##### And it goes on like this.
